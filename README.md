# üé® Emoji Optimizer

A powerful desktop tool built with Tauri and vanilla JavaScript to help you design, analyze, and optimize pixel-perfect emojis. Break down your creations on a grid, count pixels, compare versions with layers, and perfect every detail.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Pixel-Perfect Canvas**: Load any image onto a 512x512 canvas. The tool automatically fits the image while preserving its aspect ratio, creating the perfect workspace for emoji design.
* **Toggleable Grid**: Overlay a 32x32 grid (16x16 pixel squares) to guide your design and analysis. Toggle visibility to see your work with or without the grid.
* **Counting Layers**: Add layers to count and annotate specific squares. This is perfect for analyzing color distribution or ensuring symmetry.
    * **Custom Colors**: Customize the background and font color for clear visual distinction between layers.
    * **Keyboard Navigation**: Quickly move between squares with `Enter` to count the next square or `Shift+Enter` to skip.
* **Optimization Zones**: Drag to create highlighted frames around specific areas. This feature helps you focus on sections that need refinement or compare color palettes between different parts of your emoji.
* **Project Persistence**: Save your entire workspace‚Äîthe base image, all your layers, and annotations‚Äîinto a single project file.
* **Export Your Work**: Export individual layers or the final composition to standard image formats like PNG.
